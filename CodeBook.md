# Purpose
 - This document serves as the codebooks for the DataSets created by run_analysis.R. 
 - There are two Data Sets created by run_analysis.R. DataSet1.csv and DataSet2.csv
 - Both DataSet1.csv and DataSet2.csv could be located under "Result_Data_Sets" directory

# DataSet1.csv Codebook
 - This is the DataSet created as a result of Steps 1 through 4 from the assignment
 - This was created by merging "test/X_Test.txt" and "train/X_Train.txt" datasets and picking only those variables which had a mean or standard deviation measurement
 - Below are the variable names for this DataSet
    - "tBodyAcc.mean...X"               "tBodyAcc.mean...Y"               "tBodyAcc.mean...Z"                      - "tBodyAcc.std...X"                "tBodyAcc.std...Y"                "tBodyAcc.std...Z"                       - "tGravityAcc.mean...X"            "tGravityAcc.mean...Y"            "tGravityAcc.mean...Z"                   - "tGravityAcc.std...X"             "tGravityAcc.std...Y"             "tGravityAcc.std...Z"                    - "tBodyAccJerk.mean...X"           "tBodyAccJerk.mean...Y"           "tBodyAccJerk.mean...Z"                  - "tBodyAccJerk.std...X"            "tBodyAccJerk.std...Y"            "tBodyAccJerk.std...Z"                   - "tBodyGyro.mean...X"              "tBodyGyro.mean...Y"              "tBodyGyro.mean...Z"                     - "tBodyGyro.std...X"               "tBodyGyro.std...Y"               "tBodyGyro.std...Z"                      - "tBodyGyroJerk.mean...X"          "tBodyGyroJerk.mean...Y"          "tBodyGyroJerk.mean...Z"                 - "tBodyGyroJerk.std...X"           "tBodyGyroJerk.std...Y"           "tBodyGyroJerk.std...Z"                  - "tBodyAccMag.mean.."

    - "Activity"                        "Subject" 
 - The variable names for this dataset is mostly derived from "features.txt"
 - Any of the above variable names having Gyro measurements are represented in the standard gravity
units 'g'.
 - Any of the above variable names having Accelerometer (Acc) measurements are represented in the units radians/second.
 - Activity variable indicates the activity performed while taking the measurement. The possible values for this are {WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING}
 - Subject variable identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.
 - Please refer to "UCI HAR Dataset/features_info.txt" and "UCI HAR Dataset/README.md" for more details on how the initial raw data was collected.

# DataSet2.csv Codebook
 - This is the DataSet created as a result of Steps 5 from the assignment
 - This DataSet was created with DataSet1 as an input DataSet
 - This is providing a summarised/tidy dataset to indicate the mean of of all the measurements/variables from DataSet1 (Merged from Training and Test Datasets). Hence the variable values indicates just the mean of the values are not the actual raw measurement
 - Also this DataSet was created performing mean on every variable per Activity and Subject. So this is a dataset created by grouping Activity and Subject 
 - Below are the variable names for this DataSet
    - "Activity"                        "Subject" 
    - "tBodyAcc.mean...X"               "tBodyAcc.mean...Y"               "tBodyAcc.mean...Z"                      - "tBodyAcc.std...X"                "tBodyAcc.std...Y"                "tBodyAcc.std...Z"                       - "tGravityAcc.mean...X"            "tGravityAcc.mean...Y"            "tGravityAcc.mean...Z"                   - "tGravityAcc.std...X"             "tGravityAcc.std...Y"             "tGravityAcc.std...Z"                    - "tBodyAccJerk.mean...X"           "tBodyAccJerk.mean...Y"           "tBodyAccJerk.mean...Z"                  - "tBodyAccJerk.std...X"            "tBodyAccJerk.std...Y"            "tBodyAccJerk.std...Z"                   - "tBodyGyro.mean...X"              "tBodyGyro.mean...Y"              "tBodyGyro.mean...Z"                     - "tBodyGyro.std...X"               "tBodyGyro.std...Y"               "tBodyGyro.std...Z"                      - "tBodyGyroJerk.mean...X"          "tBodyGyroJerk.mean...Y"          "tBodyGyroJerk.mean...Z"                 - "tBodyGyroJerk.std...X"           "tBodyGyroJerk.std...Y"           "tBodyGyroJerk.std...Z"                  - "tBodyAccMag.mean.."
